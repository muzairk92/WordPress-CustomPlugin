## Hope Messages Form

This plugin provides a shortcode that displays a form allowing visitors to submit their name, email, an optional image, and a message. Submissions are stored as a custom post type (`hope_message`) and are published immediately so they appear below the form without requiring manual approval. The form includes basic validation, a customizable submit button, and automatically supplies a default profile picture if no image is uploaded.
